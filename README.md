## 📂 Types of Operators Covered

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical operations.

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `/` Division
* `%` Modulus
* `**` Exponentiation
* `//` Floor Division

---

### 2️⃣ Comparison (Relational) Operators

Used to compare two values.

* `==` Equal to
* `!=` Not equal to
* `>` Greater than
* `<` Less than
* `>=` Greater than or equal to
* `<=` Less than or equal to

---

### 3️⃣ Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

* `=`
* `+=`
* `-=`
* `*=`
* `/=`
* `%=`

---

### 4️⃣ Logical Operators

Used to combine conditional statements.

* `and`
* `or`
* `not`

---

### 5️⃣ Bitwise Operators

Used to perform operations on bits.

* `&` AND
* `|` OR
* `^` XOR
* `~` NOT
* `<<` Left shift
* `>>` Right shift

---

### 6️⃣ Membership Operators

Used to test membership in a sequence.

* `not in`

---

### 7️⃣ Identity Operators

Used to compare memory locations.

* `is`
* `is not`

---

## 🧪 Example

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)    # Arithmetic operator
print(a > b)    # Comparison operator
print(a and b)  # Logical operator
```
